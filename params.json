If you have experience with programming, product design, QA engineering, translation, or have a different set of skills that you want to bring to the project, your involvement is appreciated!**\r\n\r\n\r\n### SuperTurbostake Resources\r\n* Source: [Source Code](https://github.com/5mil/SuperTurbostake)\r\n* Documentation: [Build Instructions](https://github.com/5mil/SuperTurbostake/tree/master/doc)\r\n* Support: [SuperTurbostake Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1301615.0), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/5mil/SuperTurbostake/issues?state=open)\r\n\r\n\r\n### About SuperTurbostake\r\n[SuperTurbostake](http://) (abbreviated STRB) is a [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) design introducing [proof-of-stake consensus](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. SuperTurbostake is based on [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/) and Peercoin (http://peercoin.net/), while introducing many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repo Guidelines\r\n\r\n* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.\r\n* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.\r\n* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [SuperTurbostake](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1301615.0) for a broader community discussion.\r\n* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.\r\n* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.\r\n* For development ideas and help see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1301615.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Translation Guidelines\r\n\r\nChanges to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to\r\n[SuperTurbostake's Get Localization page](http://www.getlocalization.com/SuperTurbostake/).\r\n\r\nTranslations are periodically pulled from Get Localization and merged into the git repository.\r\n\r\nImportant: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next\r\npull from Get Localization would automatically overwrite them again.\r\n",
