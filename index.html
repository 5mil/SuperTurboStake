<a id="repo-guidelines" class="anchor" href="#repo-guidelines" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repo Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.</li>
<li>If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.</li>
<li>If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1301615.0">SuperTurbostake</a> for a broader community discussion.</li>
<li>The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.</li>
<li>From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.</li>
<li>For development ideas and help see <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1301615.0">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a id="translation-guidelines" class="anchor" href="#translation-guidelines" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Translation Guidelines</h2>

<p>Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
<a href="http://www.getlocalization.com/SuperTurbostake/">SuperTurbostake's Get Localization page</a>.</p>

<p>Translations are periodically pulled from Get Localization and merged into the git repository.</p>

<p>Important: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Get Localization would automatically overwrite them again.</p>
